Business Rules:
  1.	A user must be a customer or admin, or employee. 
  2.	A user without a type will be assigned as a customer.
  3.	If an item is out of stock, the item will be given the out-of-stock tag and be reflected in the UI.
  4.	If a user is an admin, show them order details, stock of food and beverages, and delivery driver information.
  5.	Orders can be completed over the phone or online. 
  6.	The restaurant database maintains the food and beverage items that it provides.
  7.	To deliver the orders, we have delivery drivers. Each driver is assigned a specific area code. The driver cannot deliver        outside the area allowed.
  8.	The customer record is maintained so that premium customers can be awarded discounts.
